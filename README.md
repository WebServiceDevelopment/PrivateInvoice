# PrivateInvoice

Private Invoice is a 
P2P based invoicing system where anyone can create their own Node
or join a managed Node in order to manage their own keys, assets,
and financial records.

### ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ WARNING!!!!! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

Private Invoice is still a work in progress, it does not include best practices
for security. Also the data format is still subject to change which will require
data to be migrated. If you create a Node, only use it for testing with fake data.
